/// @brief  Declaration of the classes used to define an XML Schema
///
/// @details A Brief Overview of XML Schema and how it will be used in Rosetta:
///
/// XML Schema describes the structure of an XML file.  The objects that
/// appear in the angle-brackets are called "Elements", e.g.
///
/// \code{.xml}
/// <MinMover name="minmover" scorefxn="talaris2014"/>
/// \endcode
///
/// is an element.
/// (aka "Tags" in Rosetta speak). The structure of the elements can be
/// described by types and these types can be user defined, e.g. the two elements:
///
/// \code{.xml}
/// <MinMover name="minmover1" scorefxn="talaris2014"/>, and
/// <MinMover name="minmover2" scorefxn="talaris2014_cst"/>
/// \endcode
///
/// could both be described as two instances that have the same type.
/// At least the way that they are used in rosetta, element types
/// almost universally fall into the XML Schema category of "complex types."
/// Complex types can contain "attributes" (e.g. the "name" and "scorefxn"
/// attributes, ) and they can also contain sub-elements organized
/// into blocks of "model groups" (sequence, choice, all & group).  Attributes
/// (aka "options" in Rosetta speak) are usually described by simple types,
/// and XML Schema defines many of them by default, (e.g. "string" and "integer"
/// types); they can also be described by "restrictions" to existing types, e.g.
/// you could define a type that is a string composed of integers separated
/// by commas (e.g. "1,34,42").
///
/// In a picture:
///
/// \verbatim
/// XMLSchemaElement --> XMLSchemaComplexType --> XMLSchemaAttribute --> XMLSchemaType --> Primative Type
///                 \--> XMLSchemaType       \--> XMLSchemaModelGroup                  \--> Restriction --> Primative Type
///                                                         \----> XMLSchemaElement
///                                                          \---> XMLSchemaModelGroup
/// \endverbatim
///
/// The chunk of XMLSchema that would describe the MinMover element above would
/// look like this: (If you thought XML was verbose, you will be overwhemed by
/// XML Schema!)
///
/// \verbatim
/// <xs:complexType name="MinMoverType" mixed="True">
///  <xs:attribute name="name" type="xs:string"/>
///  <xs:attribute name="scorefxn" type="xs:string"/>
/// </xs:complexType>
///
/// <xs:element name="MinMover" type="MinMoverType"/>
/// \endverbatim
///
/// In a XMLSchema, you can define restrictions and complex types as free standing
/// blocks, and these blocks can be given in any order.  Somewhere in the XMLSchema,
/// there needs to be a free-standing XML schema element, and this element will be
/// interpretted as the root of a tree so that an "order" can be discerned from what
/// is otherwise a jumble of types.
///
/// The way I envision schemas being defined in Rosetta is that an "XMLSchemaDefinition"
/// object is passed around between static methods of classes that are seeking to define
/// the grammar of their definitions, and other non-member utility functions (e.g. one that
/// defines the comma-separated-integer-list XMLRestriction), and that perhaps these utility
/// functions are called multiple times (with the XMLSchemaDefinition ignoring duplicate
/// definitions). After every class has described the structure of its organization, the
/// XMLSchemaDefinition can be written to a file.  Ideally, the construction of an XML schema
/// will not require the instantiation of any of the classes described in the XSD; e.g.
/// to describe the schema of the MinMover, the MoverFactory will ask the MinMoverCreator
/// for its XSD, which will defer to a static method of the MinMover. There would be no
/// need to actually instantiate a MinMover in this process.
///
/// One note about the way we use XML in rosetta:
/// When most people use XML, they embed information between two tags, e.g.
/// \code{.xml}
/// <FirstName> Andrew </FirstName>
/// \endcode
/// and we instead embed all our information as attributes (aka options) within
/// a single tag, e.g.
/// \code{.xml}
/// <FirstName value="Andrew"/>
/// \endcode
/// So our XML is a little funny. Instead of storing data between two tags, we ignore
/// everything outside of a tag.  This is allowed in XML, and so we can still used
/// XML Schema to describe our XML files.  In order to do so, we have to use the
/// feature of describing complex types where we describe the tags as "mixed". See
///
/// http://www.w3schools.com/xml/schema_complex_mixed.asp
///
/// The XMLSchemaComplexType implemented here describes all complex types as mixed;
/// this may not be appropriate for non-Rosetta XML.

/// @brief class %XMLSchemaComplexType represents the definition of the type for an element -- that is,

/// an %XMLSchemaComplexType is analogous to the wiki page describing the valid format for an instance of that Tag.
///
/// @details %XMLSchemaComplexTypes can be named or unnamed: if they are named, then the are inserted into the
/// XMLSchemaDefinition on their own, and can be referred to by name in other XMLSchemaElements; if they are
/// unnamed, then they are given as an in-line definition for an XMLSchemaElement.  So a name is not required
/// for an %XMLSchemaComplexType.  That said: the recommended structure for defining an XML Schema is that
/// complex types should be named and to live on their own -- elements should refer to these complex types by name.
///
/// (There are some who recommend that instead elements be defined at "global scope" -- i.e. directly beneath the
/// xs:schema tag -- and that complex types be unnamed.  The principle disadvantage of that idea is that you cannot
/// have two elements in different contexts with the same name but different structures. This problem of "name
/// collisions" is addressed in XML Schema through the use of "namespacing," which is horrendous, so we won't use
/// it. By giving complex types names, we can avoid name collision by just giving the complex types different
/// names, which has no effect on the apperance of the XML file itself.)
///
/// Complex types must be one of the five options in the XMLSchemaComplexTypeType.  They are either:
/// * empty (xsctt_empty) meaning that they do not contain any sub-elements, though they may contain attributes.
///   Most of the complex types in Rosetta will be declared as empty.
/// * sequence (xsctt_sequence) meaning that they may contain attributes, and that they expect every
///   one of the listed sub-elements to appear inside of them in the order defined.
/// * all (xsctt_all) meaning that they may contain attributes, and that they expect every one of the
///   listed sub-elements to appear inside of them, but that these sub-elements may appear in any order
/// * choice (xsctt_choice) meaning that they may contain attributes, and that they expect exactly one
///   of the listed sub-elements to appear, or
/// * group (xsctt_group) in which case, attributes are not allowed, and a list of subelements are given.
///   The group category is perhaps the most confusing: a complex type with a group type will contain a
///   sub-complex-type with either a sequence, all, or choice designation.  A group can be written out
///   by name, and then referred to within one or more complex types.  Interestingly, the way to define
///   flexible, recursive data types is to use a group.  For example, if the ParsedProtocolMover type can
///   contain any mover, including a ParsedProtocolMover, then to represent this in XML schema requires
///   defining a group for all movers -- and then saying that instances of this group can appear within
///   the ParsedProtocolMoverType.  Similarly, residue selectors can contain other residue selectors.
///   Look at ResidueSelectorFactory::define_residue_selector_xml_schema for an example of how
///   a group is defined.
///
/// A complex type may refer to a reference type, and then extend that type, e.g. by adding extra attributes.
///
/// In the case of a "group" complex type, the complex type needs to contain a subtype.  E.g. the group
/// complex-type defined by ResidueSelectorFactory holds a choice complex-type.
///
/// Complex types may contain subelements; these subelements can be added through a model group
/// (e.g. "xs:all") that itself contains elements and possibly other model groups.
///
/// Complex types may contain attributes; these attributes can be added through the add_attribute method.

/// @brief The %XMLComplexTypeSchemaGenerator is used to define the schema for a complex type
/// as they typically occurr in Rosetta.
///
/// @details There are seven main categories of complexTypes that regularly appear in Rosetta's
/// XML Schemas, listed in order of most common to least common:
///
/// 1) complexTypes that contain only attributes, but no subelements
///
/// 2) complexTypes that contain subelements that can repeat and that need not appear at all
///    e.g.
///    <DsspDesignOperation blueprint="somefile">
///      <Strand aa="ACDEFGH"/>
///      <Helix aa="ACDEFG"/>
///      <all append="IKLMNP"/>
///      <Helix exclude="P"/>
///    </DsspDesignOperation>
///
///    (Perhaps a repreat presence of "Helix" could be avoided, but the way DsspDesignOperation
///    works currently, repeat appearances are perfectly legal and sensical).
///
/// 3) complexTypes that contain subelements that must appear once, where the subelements are
///    allowed to appear in any order,
///
/// 4) complexTypes that contain subelements that can can appear zero or one times, where
///    the subelements are allowed to appear in any order,
///
/// 5) complexTypes where one of a set of subelements must be chosen,
///
/// 6) complexTypes where zero or one of a set of subelements can be chosen,
///
/// 7) complexTypes where elements must appear in a particular order (which is required if you have
///    two "xs:group" model groups you want both of, as is the case for the OperateOnResidueSubset
///    task operation which can hold both a "residue_selector" group and a "res_lvl_task_op" group),
///    and
///
/// 8) complexTypes that have ordered sets of subelements where each set is either:
///        a) repeatable,
///        b) optional,
///        c) required,
///        d) pick-one-from-a-list, or
///        e) pick-one-or-none-from-a-list.
///    In these complexTypes, no elements may appear in multiple sets.
///
///    For example, it's ok if you want to say "the <Option> subtag is first and it's either there or
///    not, and then afterwards you can have as many <ScoreFunction> and <TaskOperation> tags as you
///    want in any order, and finally, you can put either a single <PackRotamersMover> tag or a
///    <RotamerTrialsMover> tag." This would be like saying that the first set has an <Option>
///    element, and that it is optional, that the second set has both a <ScoreFunction> element
///    and a <TaskOperation> element and the elements of this set are repeatable, and that finally,
///    a third set contains the <PackRotamersMover> element and the <RotamerTrialsMover>, and that
///    neither has to appear but only one of the two may appear, and only once.
///
///    However, you cannot say
///    "The <Option> subtag is first, and its either there or not, and then afterwards, you
///    can have as many <ScoreFunction> and <TaskOperation> tags as you want, and then afterwards
///    you may have another <Option> subtag," because then the <Option> tag would appear in
///    two sets (the first and the third).
///    (The reason for this is restriction is to avoid violating the unique particle attribution
///    rule of XML Schema: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unique_Particle_Attribution )
///
/// Clearly XML Schema can support more kinds of elements than the eight that are supported by
/// this class, but these are the ones that seem to appear the most frequently. All
/// functionality provided by this class can also be accomplished using the XMLSchemaComplexType
/// and XMLSchemaElement classes, but would require a deeper understanding of XML Schema. The
/// niche that this class fills is to make it easy for developers to provide XSDs for these
/// most-common case. Adding additional functionality to this class comes at the expense of
/// making it less clear how the class should be used.  Write me if you feel that there
/// categories that should be added.
