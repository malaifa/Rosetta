/// LarvalJobs that have the same inputs, but differ in their random number seed (i.e.
/// replicates); two jobs that share the same input are meant to point to the same
/// "InnerLarvalJob" to avoid spending too much memory representing identical data.

/// @details Note that in JD2, the currently running Job was globally accessible.  That is not
/// the case in JD3.  Any data that should be output by a running job must be tucked
/// by a Mover inside the JobOutputData to be eventually retrieved by the JobQueen
/// or by a JobDataOutputter at the end of execution.
