/// new JobQueens easy, this class's API has been carefully designed to be easy to work with and
/// the class itself has been designed to do as much heavy lifting as possible and to leave only
/// the responsibilities that the %StandardJobQueen could not perform to the derived classes.

	///
	/// @details The process begins by first constructing the job definition and resource definition
	/// XSDs.  With these schemas, the %StandardJobQueen validates the input XML files (if present).
	/// The %StandardJobQueen then populates preliminary versions of LarvalJob objects./ If the XSD
	/// includes "command line options" (which may be specified either from the command line or in
	/// the <options> section of the Job XML file), the %StandardJobQueen loads the preliminary
	/// LarvalJob objects with the options. These preliminary LarvalJob objects will not have been
	/// nstruct expanded (i.e. if there are 100 nstruct for each of 5 different jobs, then there will
	/// only be 5 preliminary larval jobs created). It then passes the preliminary LarvalJob list and
	/// the TagOP objects for each preliminary LarvalJob to the derived class through the
